## What Is Azure Event Grid?

Azure Event Grid is a **centralized event routing service** in Azure that enables seamless communication between event publishers and subscribers. It follows the **Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) model**, allowing you to build event-based, reactive applications easily.

- **Centralized Event Routing:** Efficiently routes events from various Azure services or custom sources to event handlers.
- **Publish-Subscribe Model:** Decouples event producers from event consumers, enabling scalable and loosely coupled architectures.
- **High Availability and Reliability:** Built to handle massive scale with low latency and built-in retry mechanisms.
