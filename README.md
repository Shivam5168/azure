# 🌐 Azure Services with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Learning Documentation

Welcome to my personal knowledge base and hands-on documentation repository where I explore and implement various **Azure cloud services** using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools like **Terraform**, **ARM templates**, and **Bicep**.

This repository is intended to document my continuous learning, experiments, and use-case implementations on Azure, focusing on automating deployments and managing infrastructure in a scalable, secure, and repeatable way.
